A                    D
 She is a lady, comes from all around
A                            D
 She's many places, but she's homeward bound
            A
And now she walks kinda funny
I think she knows
D
Day by day by day
Our love grows
A                   D
 She's a lantern in the night
She's outta sight

A                           D
 Electric gold our love with tender care
A                     D
 Hills of satin grass and maidens fair
        A
Now she rides through the night
On a silver storm
D
Sword in hand
Our fate's torn
A                   D
 She's a sparrow of the dawn
Our love is born
